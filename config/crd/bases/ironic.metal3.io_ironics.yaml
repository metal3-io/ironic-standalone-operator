                                PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                            is restarted or not. Constraints on the rules:
                            - At most 20 rules are allowed.
                            - Rules can have the same action.
                            - Identical rules are not forbidden in validations.
                            When rules are specified, container MUST set RestartPolicy explicitly
                            even it if matches the Pod's RestartPolicy.

                                Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).

                                  the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                  to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                  "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                  Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                  exists or not.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                            have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.
